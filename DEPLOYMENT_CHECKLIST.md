## ðŸ›  Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Hugging Face Space
```bash
# Go to https://huggingface.co/new-space
# Choose "Streamlit" SDK
# Select appropriate hardware (CPU recommended)
```

### 2. Clone and Deploy
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahelmain/AI-Human-Text-Detection-Hugging-Face.git
cd AI-Human-Text-Detection-Hugging-Face

# Add HF remote
git remote add hf https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME

# Push to HF
git push hf main
```

### 3. Monitor Deployment
- Check build logs in HF Space
- Verify model loading works
- Test all functionality
- Monitor performance metrics

## ðŸ“Š Performance Expectations

### Model Loading Times
- Essential models: < 30 seconds
- All models: < 60 seconds
- NLTK data: < 10 seconds

### Response Times
- Single prediction: < 3 seconds
- Batch processing: < 10 seconds per text
- File upload: < 30 seconds

### Resource Usage
- Memory: ~2-4GB peak
- CPU: 2 cores minimum
- Storage: ~500MB for models

## ðŸ”§ Optimization Features

### Caching
- Model caching with Streamlit cache_resource
- Prediction result caching for identical inputs
- NLTK data caching

### Memory Management
- Automatic garbage collection
- Memory usage monitoring
- Cache cleanup when memory is high

### Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting (100 requests/hour)
- XSS and injection protection
- Session management

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Run deployment tests:
```bash
python test_deployment.py
```

Expected output:
```
âœ… Ready for Hugging Face deployment!
- All required files present
- Models load successfully
- Dependencies are valid
- Configuration is correct
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Models not loading:**
- Check file paths in `models/` directory
- Verify pickle files are not corrupted
- Ensure sufficient memory allocation

**NLTK data errors:**
- Run `python setup_nltk.py` manually
- Check internet connectivity for downloads
- Verify NLTK_DATA environment variable

**Memory issues:**
- Reduce model cache size in config
- Enable automatic memory cleanup
- Use CPU-only mode for large models

**Slow performance:**
- Enable model preloading
- Increase cache TTL values
- Use smaller text inputs for testing

## ï¿½ï¿½ Monitoring

### Built-in Analytics
- Real-time usage statistics
- Model performance metrics
